## Reason

There are many dating apps out there, but the majority of them are out to make<br>
money and not really help people find love. Online dating apps are purposely<br> 
designed to make it difficult for people to find a match. The longer a user<br> 
stays on the app, the more likely the app owner will make money. I made this<br> 
app because I want to help people find love and be happy; for me, that is <br>
more important than making money.

## How do most dating apps work?

Most dating apps play on the user's desire to find a beautiful match. Most people want<br>
to be with someone who is attractive, rich, or both. Personality is not something
that is emphasized on dating apps; it is mostly about appearances.

### Rating System (Elo Rating System)

Most dating apps use some sort of rating system to determine how desirable a<br>
person is. Each person has a score that is based on the number of likes and dislikes<br>
they have received. The users with high scores are deemed to be more desirable<br>
and in turn, are more likely to be used to entice others to stay in the app and pursue them.

<br>
The Elo rating system is a rating system that is used in some online dating apps<br>
to determine the score of a given user. The rules are simple:<br>

```
1. Each user start with a high score of some number.
2. Score increases when the user dislikes someone with a higher score
3. Score decreases when the user likes someone with a lower score
```

### There are extra rules 

```
1. Score decreases if the user only likes or dislikes every profile
2. Score increases the more often the user uses the app
```

## How do dating apps make money?

There are three ways a free dating app can make money:

```
1. Advertisments
2. In app purchases
3. Selling users' personal information 
```

Most dating apps will combine these three methods to make money. The longer you<br>
stay on the app, the more money they make.



## Why online dating?

Most people meet their partners at school, work, or through a mutual friend.<br>
If someone is not in school, doesn't work, or doesn't have friends will have a <br>
a difficult time finding love. Even if someone is in school, has a job, and friends,<br>
they might not be able to find love from those groups. Most who are against<br>
online dating apps always suggest finding a hobby or a group of some sort and<br>
hoping to find love through those connections. But this is not the case. One<br>
shouldn't join a book or sports club to find love. Online dating allows people<br>
to continue to live their lives the same way and still find love.
